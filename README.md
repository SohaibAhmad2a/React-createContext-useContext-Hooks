#React createContext and useContext Hook:
createContext and useContext are used together to avoid prop drilling.
##How to use the files:
I only pushed those files that I changed. If you want to run these files, first initiate the react library in any directory, then paste these files in the src folder.
Once it is done, then run "npm start" in cmd. There are two files in this repository.
**i.** learning.js this is only to understand what are createContext and useContext hook, and how to use them. It contains two programs one without context hooks, while 
the other is with context hooks. Here you will actually see how prop drilling can be avoided with use of context hooks.
**ii.** index.js contains a program in which an integer is printed and you can increment or 
decrement it by pressing the button.
